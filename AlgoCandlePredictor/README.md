## 🎓 Technical Deep Dive

### Hybrid XGBoost-LSTM Architecture

**Why This Approach?**

Based on 2024 research, hybrid models achieve 98%+ accuracy by combining:
- **XGBoost**: Feature importance ranking, handles tabular data excellently
- **LSTM**: Captures temporal dependencies in time-series data

**Our Implementation:**

1. **Stage 1 - XGBoost Feature Selection**
   - Trains on all 30+ technical indicators
   - Ranks features by importance (F-score)
   - Selects top 15 most predictive features
   - Reduces dimensionality and noise

2. **Stage 2 - LSTM Prediction**
   - 3-layer LSTM with dropout and batch normalization
   - 128 → 64 → 32 units (progressive reduction)
   - Trained only on selected features
   - Sequence length: 60 candles (5 hours of 5-min data)
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting

### Kelly Criterion Position Sizing

**Formula**: `Kelly % = (W × R - (1 - W)) / R`

Where:
- W = Win rate (from historical trades)
- R = Average Win / Average Loss ratio

**Our Implementation**:
- Use **Half-Kelly** (50% of full Kelly) for safety
- Adjust by model confidence score
- Cap at max_position_size limit
- Integrate ATR for volatility adjustment

**Example**:
- Win rate: 60%
- Win/Loss ratio: 2:1
- Full Kelly: 40%
- Half-Kelly: 20%
- With 75% confidence: 15% of capital

### Risk Management Philosophy

Inspired by top quant firms:

1. **Diversification**: Never more than 2% risk per trade
2. **Correlation**: Monitor correlation between positions
3. **Drawdown Control**: Stop trading at daily loss limit
4. **Confidence Filtering**: Only trade high-confidence signals (>72%)
5. **Dynamic Sizing**: Reduce size in high volatility (using ATR)

## 📈 Performance Metrics

After training and backtesting, you'll see:

- **Directional Accuracy**: % of correct predictions
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return (target: 1.5+)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Win Rate**: % of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / Gross loss
- **Average Trade P&L**: Mean profit per trade

## ⚙️ Next Steps

1. **Train the Model**: Run `python models/train.py`
2. **Review Results**: Check accuracy metrics and saved models
3. **Test Predictions**: Use `/trading/predict` endpoint
4. **Start Demo Trading**: Set `mode: demo` in config
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track P&L and statistics
6. **Optimize**: Adjust confidence threshold based on results
7. **Go Live**: When ready, switch to `mode: live` with real broker API

## 🔒 Safety Features

- **Demo Mode**: Test without risking real money
- **Kill Switch**: Emergency stop via `/admin/killswitch`
- **Loss Limits**: Automatic trading stops at limits
- **Position Checks**: Prevent duplicate positions
- **Confidence Filtering**: Only trade high-quality signals
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of all trades

## 📞 Broker Integration (Coming Soon)

To connect to your broker (Zerodha/AngelOne):

1. Get API credentials from your broker
2. Add credentials as environment variables
3. Update `trading/executor.py` with broker SDK
4. Test in demo mode first
5. Switch to live trading
