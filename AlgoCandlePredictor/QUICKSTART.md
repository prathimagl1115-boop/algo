# Quick Start Guide

## Your Trading Bot is Ready! üöÄ

The API server is already **RUNNING** on port 5000. Here's how to get started in 3 simple steps:

## Step 1: Explore the API

Visit the interactive API documentation:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:5000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/system/health

Try this in your browser or terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/system/status
```

You'll see the complete system status including:
- Configuration settings
- Trading session status
- Performance metrics
- Model information

## Step 2: Train Your ML Model

Run the training script to train on 194K+ candles of ULTRACEMCO data:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

**What happens during training:**
- Loads 194,561 candles (5-minute data from 2015-2025)
- Calculates 30+ technical indicators
- Trains XGBoost for feature selection
- Trains LSTM on selected features
- Saves trained models to `trained_models/`
- Shows accuracy metrics

**Training time:** 10-20 minutes

**Expected results:**
- Directional Accuracy: 70%+
- Saved models ready for trading

## Step 3: Start Demo Trading

After training, test predictions with the API:

```bash
# Get a prediction
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/trading/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "ULTRACEMCO",
    "open": 11500.0,
    "high": 11550.0,
    "low": 11480.0,
    "close": 11520.0,
    "volume": 125000
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "symbol": "ULTRACEMCO",
  "prediction": "UP",
  "confidence": 0.7845,
  "should_trade": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T10:30:00"
}
```

## Common Questions

**Q: How accurate is the model?**
A: Target is 70%+ directional accuracy. You'll see actual results after training.

**Q: Is demo mode safe?**
A: Yes! Demo mode uses virtual money. No real trades executed.

**Q: What is Kelly Criterion?**
A: Mathematical formula for optimal position sizing used by top hedge funds.

**Q: How much risk per trade?**
A: Default is 2% of capital (Half-Kelly conservative approach).
